Fund and Share profiles
-----------------------

A significant part of my work was producing Fund and Share product reports (profiles).

Features included:
* On demand and batch creation
* Caching
* Custom client branding and layouts
* Delivery via SOAP, FTP and HTTP

PDF files were generated using Apache FOP:

All charts and graphics were done in SVG, so the reports had very high quality images with very small file sizes.

Share charts were produced with a custom engine I wrote myself; fund charts were from an engine written by one of my colleagues.
